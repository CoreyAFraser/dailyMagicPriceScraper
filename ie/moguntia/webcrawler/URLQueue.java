/**
 * Class URLQueue
 *
 * This class implements the ie.moguntia.Queue interface for queues of 'tasks'
 * in a multithreaded environment.
 *
 * This class has a queue and a set of URLs (exactly: Strings that represent
 * URLs). Synchronised methods are provided for inserting in both the set
 * and the queue, retrieving (and removing) an element from the queue only and
 * for clearing the queue.
 *
 * The intended use of this class is inside a web crawler.
 * The crawler can add new urls as it encounters them, and another thread
 * can pop the queue and crawl the remaining urls.
 *
 * A 'depth level' is supported. If you run a multithreaded crawler and want
 * want to know, how far a certain page is away from your starting point,
 * e.g. for limiting the maximum crawling depth, you must take care that
 * the crawlers only read urls from level n and add new urls to be processed
 * to level n+1. This is important. The reason: Consider the following link
 * structure (capital letters denoting pages and -> denoting a link):
 * A->B, B->C, A->C, C->D. The maximum link depth in this example is 2.
 * So, you want page D to stored, because (A->C->D) its distance from A is 2.
 * But what if the crawler first processes the link B->C, before it gathers
 * A->C ? In this case, your crawler might think, D's distance from A is 3.
 * If C->D has not been processed yet, the crawler might still be able to
 * update the distance for C, but what if D has already been discarded,
 * because it is too far away? As you see, this gets very messy, so it is
 * better to prevent that two or more crawlers 'overtake' each other by
 * just synchronizing them.
 *
 * Because we only read from level n and write to n+1, only two queues need
 * to be supported, not a queue for each level. When pushing or popping
 * elements to/from the queue, we can use the depth level modulo 2 to determine
 * which queue to use.
 * 
 * In a multithreaded crawler, a thread should die, if pop(n) returns null.
 * This way, the crawler can be halted by clearing the queue.
 * If no thread is running any more for depth level n, a thread manager may
 * decide to create new threads for depth level n+1.
 *
 * In addition to the methods defined by the interface queue, this class
 * supports a String as additional data that is through this way handed over
 * to the thread. This string is used to specifiy a filename prefix, where
 * the retrieved files are stored.
 *
 * This code is in the public domain.
